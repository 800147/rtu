# Russian-Tatar united keyboard layout</h1>

![icon](docs/favicon.svg)

This is a new keyboard layout that is the same as the Russian one but
with Tatar letters set as an alternative symbols (with the
<kbd>rAlt</kbd> or right alt pressed). The Tatar letters are located
above their Russian pairs (<kbd>rAlt</kbd> + <kbd>а</kbd> for "ә",
<kbd>rAlt</kbd> + <kbd>н</kbd>
for "ң", etc.), so that it is easy to find them and no need to remember
their location.
